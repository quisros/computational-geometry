# Computational Geometry

This repository documents my work done in the Computational Geometry project offered by [WnCC](https://wncc-iitb.org) under Seasons of Code 2021. An overview of the project can be found [here](https://wncc-iitb.org/soc_projects/88-comp-geo.html).

After understanding and implementing some of the fundamental computational geometry algorithms and techniques, I aim to explore the applications of these algorithms in the field of computer graphics and structural biology.

#### Phase 1: March-April

Studied the following fundamental problems and understood the relevant proofs and algorithms to solve them, following these CMSC 754 lecture notes by Prof. David M. Mount, University of Maryland. [Link](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf)

1. Fixed-Radius Near Neighbour Problem
2. Convex Hull Problem
3. Line Segment Intersection

#### Phase 2: May

Understood the relevant proofs and algorithms of all and completed code implementations of some of the following problems from Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications. [Link](https://people.inf.elte.hu/fekete/algoritmusok_msc/terinfo_geom/konyvek/Computational%20Geometry%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Applications,%203rd%20Ed.pdf) 

1. Polygon Triangulation
2. Orthogonal Range Searching
3. Point Location
4. Voronoi Diagrams
5. Delaunay Triangulations

#### Phase 3: June-July

Read several papers involving applications of computational geometry in various areas, and attempted implementations of a few. Mainly focused on the following papers:

1. Convex Decomposition of Polyhedra and Robustness. [link](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1841&context=cstech)
2. Shelling the Voronoi interface of protein-protein complexes reveals patterns of residue conservation, dynamics, and composition. [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19280599/)
3. A simple method for finding a protein’s ligand-binding pockets. [link](https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6807-14-18)
