# Computational Geometry

This repository documents my work done in the Computational Geometry project offered by [WnCC](https://wncc-iitb.org) under Seasons of Code 2021. An overview of the project can be found [here](https://wncc-iitb.org/soc_projects/88-comp-geo.html).

After understanding and implementing some of the fundamental computational geometry algorithms and techniques, I aim to explore the applications of these algorithms in the field of computer graphics and structural biology.

### Progress till first checkpoint

Studied the following fundamental problems and understood the relevant proofs and algorithms to solve them:

1. Fixed-Radius Near Neighbour Problem
2. Convex Hull Problem
3. Line Segment Intersection
4. Polygon Triangulation

### Progress till second checkpoint

Understood the relevant proofs and algorithms and completed code implementations of the following problems:

1. Line Segment Intersection
2. Polygon Triangulation
3. Orthogonal Range Searching
4. Point Location
5. Voronoi Diagrams
6. Delaunay Triangulations

Studied [this](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1841&context=cstech) paper on the topic of polyhedral decomposition - an application of computational geometry in computer graphics - and working on completing the code implementation of the described methods constituting the algorithm. Also reading papers on the application of computational geometry algorithms in structural biology, which will be the next focus of the project.
