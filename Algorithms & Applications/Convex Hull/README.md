## Convex Hull Problem

Running instructions:

<code> python3 convexHull.py number </code>

To run the brute force algorithm: replace number with 1

To run Graham's scan: replace number with 2

The program will ask for input of points after running the above instruction.

Example input of points: <code>8 6 2 9 8 7 5 3 4 6 5 1 0 9 6 9 4 7 5 6 5 2 9 8 1 3 8 0 1 2</code>

A png file with the entered points marked in red and the computed polygon drawn in blue will be generated.
